Re-implementation of original Tetris as it looked in 1984
=========================================================

First version of Tetris [looked funny](https://www.firstversions.com/2015/11/tetris.html) and it was a nice exercise to re-implement its original looks.

How to run:

```
$ go run .
```

How to play:

Use `w`, `a`, `s` and `d`. Do not expect this to be a fully fledged game, it's just a fun exercice after all.
